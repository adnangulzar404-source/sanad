# therefore landing in the scored text, with the trailing material a median
# 40% of the stored string.

# followed by CHAIN MATERIAL -- a narrator's name and then another link ("an",

# anchored on what precedes it instead (an attribution, "qala <name>"), which

# verbs with a preposition behind them, not a chain.
